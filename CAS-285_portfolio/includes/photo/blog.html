<p> Time flies when we are having fun.  The start of the new school year is just around the corner, where did summer go.  While rushing around and getting the kids together and settling into our new routines.  Take time to plan some Beautiful Fall time shots of Seniors graduating this year. We only get one chance to take advantage of the wondrous colors Fall brings.</p>
<p>On another note the last of the summer coast trips has been planned I should be updating some of our Places photos and posting them soon.</p>

<p>How do I love you let me count the ways,..........one one thousand, two one-thousand, three.  Well way more than that.  As the heat grows, alas so does the time indoors I had hope to use this time more productivity.  Sometimes when the work is done time with family is much better.  That is where I find myself today, time with family is just better.</p>
